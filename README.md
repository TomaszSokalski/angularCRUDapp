# AngularCRUDapp

It's my first crud simply application with angular.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.4.

## Development server

- Clone this repository.
- Run 'npm install'.
- Run json-serwer --watch db.json (if you don't install globally yet do this command 'npm install -g json-server') for fake serwer.
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
